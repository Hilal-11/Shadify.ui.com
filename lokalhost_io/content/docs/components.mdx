# All Components

Welcome to the complete component catalog of **localhost.io**.

This page contains **every component currently available** in the library — all designed to be **functional, production-ready, and easy to customize**.

Each component can be installed individually using the CLI and lives directly inside your codebase.



import ComponentsAll from './componentsAll'

    <div className='relative'><ComponentsAll /></div>

## What you’ll find here

The components listed below are built to solve **real application needs**, not just visual styling.

You’ll find:
- Reusable UI primitives
- Application-level components
- Interactive and animated elements
- Accessible and responsive components
- Components designed for SaaS, dashboards, and modern apps

All components follow the same core principles:
- **Source-owned** (copied into your project)
- **Type-safe**
- **Accessible by default**
- **Production-tested**
