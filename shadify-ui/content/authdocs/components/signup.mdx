# CLI Reference

The **localhost.io** ecosystem is powered by the **shadcn CLI registry system**.

This CLI allows you to:
- Initialize your project with best-practice defaults
- Add production-ready components directly into your codebase
- Automatically install required dependencies
- Preview and explore components before installation

All actions are performed **directly from your terminal**, keeping your workflow fast and predictable.
